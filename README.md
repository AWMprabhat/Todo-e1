Understanding Component Structure

Counter
*Note - Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders. Changing component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks.

Understanding Data Structure
tasks.json
Initial Tasks to be shown on screen.
Note - Make sure you use only the given data and dont create new data. Changing data might result in giving you zero marks

# Features to build
User should be able to add task from AddTask component.
User Should not be able to add empty task.
User Should not be able to add duplicate tasks.
Whenever a new Task is added count value is 1 by default.
User Should be able to mark Task as Completed in Task component.
Every Task should have different internal Counter with values. Note - Make sure you implelement features one by one and deploy the app correctly
General Instructions (IMPORTANT)
Do not use Global CSS, instead use <componentName>.module.css convention for Css in that file.
Do Not Remove data-cy="xxxx" from anywhere, this are used by testing tools to test your code, removal of this will lead to low score.
Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders as chaging component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks
Make sure you use only the given data and dont create new data, as chaging data might result in giving you zero marks
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
